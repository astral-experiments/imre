        lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be

        a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
        positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
        infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            Var[X] = 1 / lambd ** 2
